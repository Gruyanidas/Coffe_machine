☕ Coffee Machine Simulator

Welcome to Coffee Machine Simulator, a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple coffee vending machine. This project was one of the first stepping stones in learning Python, focusing on functions, loops, conditionals, and handling user input effectively.
🎯 Project Overview

This program allows users to: ✅ Order coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino)
✅ Insert coins to pay for the coffee
✅ Check machine resources (water, milk, coffee, money)
✅ Refill the machine when resources run low
✅ Power off the machine when needed

The goal was to practice basic Python programming concepts while creating an interactive console-based application.
🛠 Technologies Used

    Python 3
    Data Handling (Dictionaries)
    Looping & Conditionals
    Function-based Programming
    Modularization for Maintainability

🚀 How to Run the Program

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/coffee-machine.git
cd coffee-machine

2️⃣ Run the Script

python coffee_machine.py

3️⃣ Follow the on-screen prompts

    Choose a coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino)
    Insert coins
    Receive your coffee or get a refund if insufficient funds
    Type "report" to check resources
    Type "recharge" to refill resources
    Type "off" to turn off the machine

🏆 Lessons Learned

This project was one of my first Python projects, helping me understand:

    How to use functions effectively
    How to work with dictionaries for data storage
    How to handle user input dynamically
    The importance of code structure & readability

It was a great learning experience, and now, looking back, it's amazing to see how much progress has been made since then!
💡 Future Improvements

🔹 Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
🔹 Implement database storage for persistent sales tracking
🔹 Introduce more drink options and customization
🔹 Improve error handling & input validation
